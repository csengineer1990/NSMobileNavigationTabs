# NSMobileNavigationTabs
**Task**

**NS Mini Project Designing the Mobile Navigation Tab Screen**

Take a look at this simple and good looking UI. Like always, working on HTML CSS is all about figuring out the layout and the structure.

Divide the whole UI Into Divs (or sections if you want to use HTML5!)
See how they have centred the whole layout and used border radius and shadow
for styling!
You can use flexbox for the layout and positioning.
And you can select the icons from here: https://fontawesome.com/icons

A detail that you might have missed: The colour of the bottom border is not the
same as the colour of bottom navigation bar!
Try your best to create this UI and implement it in the cool stuff you make in future.
Experiment with the colours, add your favourite wallpaper and make this yours!
If you can, try to make the colour of the icons change on hovering using CSS!

**Solution and Learn**

In NS Mini project assignement, we learn how to make simple mobile tab navigation using HTML and CSS. The design is simple and the code is easy to understand. You can download the design from the download link given below and test it on your own.

The design is responsive. For window size above 600px, you will see a regular type navigation bar and as the size comes below 600px (which is generally in the case of mobiles) tab navigation will be shown in the below as per the task given.
